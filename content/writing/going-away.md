We flew into Parigi as it was a direct flight from Chicago and I personally have never been out of the country before. When the planes wheels touched the ground I immediately felt the joy of being in Europe, as if the duality of calmness yet liveliness was seeping through the plane’s curved walls. Our naïvety carried us through until we stepped out of our first train ride into a station whom greeted us with these glass doors. I made it through by sheer luck. My partner, however, was stuck on the other side. Thankfully, a kind lady saw us struggling and used her ticket to swing the door open to reunite us once again. We only had a night here until moving on to Italy so we wanted to make the most of it. But first, I had to wash my barefoot shoes. Our room had a washer, lovely. After 30 minutes or so passed, I looked at this machine, assuming it was also a dryer since there was only this single appliance. Then it hit me. I was 6638 kilometers away from home, with wet shoes and no way to dry them. Okay, it’s not that dramatic but definitely quite funny. My generous partner explored the neighboring stores for a suitable replacement pair of shoes and we continued our journey.
